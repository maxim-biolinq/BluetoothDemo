# Refactoring Summary: BluetoothSession Wrapper

## Problem Solved
The original `BluetoothViewModel` was violating the Single Responsibility Principle by handling both view model duties and complex component wiring/orchestration. This made it harder to test, maintain, and reuse the Bluetooth functionality.

## Solution Implemented
Created `BluetoothSession` - a wrapper class in the `BluetoothComponents` package that:

1. **Encapsulates component wiring**: Handles all the complex `Combine` wiring between `BluetoothController`, `PeripheralFilter`, and `PeripheralService`
2. **Provides a simple public API**: Exposes easy-to-use methods like `startScanning()`, `setFilter(text:)`, `connect(peripheral:)`, etc.
3. **Manages component lifecycle**: Automatically creates/destroys `PeripheralService` instances when peripherals connect/disconnect
4. **Publishes consolidated state**: Exposes `@Published` properties for all relevant UI state

## Key Architectural Benefits

### Simplicity ✅
- `BluetoothViewModel` went from 85+ lines to 72 lines
- No more complex wiring logic in the view model
- Clear, single-purpose methods

### Modularity ✅
- Clean separation of concerns between UI layer and Bluetooth logic
- `BluetoothSession` can be easily reused in different contexts
- Individual components remain available for advanced use cases

### Testability ✅
- `BluetoothSession` can be mocked for view model tests
- Component wiring is isolated and testable separately
- Clear input/output boundaries

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
- `BluetoothComponents/Sources/BluetoothComponents/BluetoothSession.swift` - Main wrapper class
- `BluetoothComponents/Tests/BluetoothComponentsTests/BluetoothSessionTests.swift` - Unit tests
- `BluetoothComponents/USAGE_GUIDE.md` - Documentation and examples

### Modified Files:
- `BluetoothDemo/Models/BluetoothViewModel.swift` - Simplified to use `BluetoothSession`
- `BluetoothComponents/Sources/BluetoothComponents/PeripheralService.swift` - Made `ServiceState` Equatable

## Usage Examples

### Simple Approach (Recommended)
```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let session = BluetoothSession()

    func scan() { session.startScanning() }
    func filter(_ text: String) { session.setFilter(text: text) }
    // Session handles all component wiring automatically
}
```

### Advanced Approach (Custom wiring)
```swift
class CustomViewModel: ObservableObject {
    private let controller = BluetoothController()
    private let filter = PeripheralFilter()
    // Manual wiring for specialized needs
}
```

## Validation
✅ Project builds successfully
✅ All functionality preserved
✅ Cleaner architecture achieved
✅ Both simple and advanced usage patterns supported

The refactoring successfully achieves the goal of removing component wiring responsibilities from the view model while providing a convenient, reusable wrapper for common Bluetooth operations.

# Bluetooth Info Request Implementation

## Summary

I have successfully implemented the `getInfo` functionality in Swift for the BluetoothController, translating the Python reference implementation to work with the existing iOS architecture.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. BluetoothController Extensions

**File**: `BluetoothComponents/Sources/BluetoothComponents/BluetoothController.swift`

Added the following functionality:

#### New Properties:
- `infoRequestInput`: PassthroughSubject to trigger info requests
- `infoResponseOutput`: PassthroughSubject to publish info responses
- `InfoResponseData`: Public struct to expose info response data

#### New Methods:
- `requestDeviceInfo()`: Public method to request device info
- `handleInfoRequest()`: Constructs and sends info request messages
- `constructInfoRequest()`: Creates BLE protobuf message structure
- `parseNotificationData()`: Parses incoming protobuf responses
- `handleInfoResponse()`: Processes InfoResponse messages

### 2. Package Dependencies

**File**: `BluetoothComponents/Package.swift`

Added SwiftProtobuf dependency:
```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-protobuf.git", from: "1.21.0")
]
```

### 3. ViewModel Integration

**File**: `BluetoothDemo/Models/BluetoothViewModel.swift`

Added:
- `@Published var lastInfoResponse`: Exposes info responses to UI
- `requestDeviceInfo()`: Method to trigger info requests
- Reactive binding between controller and UI

### 4. UI Integration

**File**: `BluetoothDemo/Views/BluetoothView.swift`

Added:
- "Get Info" button to trigger info requests
- Info response display section showing:
  - Number of blocks
  - Timestamp
  - Status

## Key Implementation Details

### Message Construction
The implementation follows the Python reference by constructing a `BLEMessage` with:
- Sequence number (currently hardcoded to 1)
- RX channel with InfoRequest
- Proper protobuf structure matching the Python version

### Response Parsing
The notification handler:
1. Parses incoming data as `BLEMessage` protobuf
2. Checks for TX channel messages
3. Extracts InfoResponse from response messages
4. Converts to public `InfoResponseData` struct
5. Publishes via Combine for UI updates

### Error Handling
- Validates connection state before sending requests
- Handles protobuf serialization/deserialization errors
- Provides meaningful error messages and logging

## Usage Flow

1. **Scan and Connect**: Use existing scan/connect functionality
2. **Request Info**: Tap "Get Info" button or call `viewModel.requestDeviceInfo()`
3. **Receive Response**: Info response appears in UI automatically via reactive binding

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Core BluetoothController info request functionality
- Protobuf message construction and parsing
- Reactive Combine-based architecture
- UI integration with SwiftUI
- Package dependency configuration

⚠️ **Pending:**
- Xcode project build completion (packages are resolving dependencies)
- Final testing with actual BLE device

## Next Steps

Once the Xcode build completes successfully:
1. Test the info request functionality with a real BLE device
2. Verify protobuf message formatting matches device expectations
3. Add proper sequence number management if needed
4. Consider adding timeout handling for requests

## Architecture Highlights

The implementation maintains the existing modular architecture:
- **Separation of Concerns**: UI, ViewModel, and Controller remain separate
- **Reactive Programming**: Uses Combine for data flow
- **Type Safety**: Public API uses safe Swift types instead of raw protobuf types
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection and serialization errors
